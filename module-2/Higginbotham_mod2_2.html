        <p>When I am not at work or studying for school I like to focus on my hobbies. Which include playing guitar, journaling, and producing music. My free time mostly revolves around music.</p>
        <p>I am currently living with my mom. My family is scattered all over the United States. I have family in Utah, Colorado, Rhode island, California, and Idaho. I am glad telephones exist!</p>
        <p> My childhood was far from perfect. I grew up with lots of dysfunction. I used to live in a middle class household but now we are living paycheck to paycheck. <span class="sentence"> It is stressful but we are managing.</span></p>
